## Cherry Blossom e-commerce 

This project is a e-commerce website that you are able to add items to your cart, update their quantities, remove them and clear the entire cart in a simulated purchase.

I've used Bootstrap v5.0 to help with styling and main components and Vanilla Javascript to give more functionalities to the front-end.

In this case, the data will not be saved, so there isn't a backend.
